## Introduction

Kubernetes is a powerful platform for managing containerized applications. While many tools automate the setup process, this repository focuses on manual installation. By following this guide, you will learn the essential components and configurations that make up a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of Linux command-line tools.
- Access to a cloud provider or a local setup with multiple machines.
- `kubectl` installed on your local machine.
- Basic networking knowledge.

## Architecture Overview

Kubernetes operates on a master-slave architecture. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the components involved:

- **Master Node**: Controls the cluster and manages the API server, scheduler, and controller manager.
- **Worker Nodes**: Run the applications and services. Each worker node includes a Kubelet, Kube Proxy, and a container runtime.
- **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that holds all cluster data.
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, which can contain one or more containers.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Provision Virtual Machines**: Create at least three VMsâ€”one for the master and two for workers.
2. **Install Required Packages**: Ensure you have Docker and other necessary tools installed on all machines.

### Step 2: Configuring the Master Node

1. **Install Kubernetes Components**: Download and install the Kubernetes binaries on the master node.
2. **Set Up etcd**: Initialize etcd to store cluster data.
3. **Start the API Server**: Launch the API server and configure it to use etcd.

### Step 3: Configuring Worker Nodes

1. **Install Kubernetes Components**: Repeat the installation process for the worker nodes.
2. **Join the Cluster**: Use the token generated by the master to join the worker nodes to the cluster.

### Step 4: Deploying Your First Application

1. **Create a Deployment**: Use `kubectl` to create a simple deployment.
2. **Expose the Deployment**: Make your application accessible via a service.

### Step 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Set Up Monitoring Tools**: Implement monitoring solutions to keep track of cluster health.
2. **Regular Backups**: Schedule regular backups of your etcd data.

## Common Issues

- **Connection Timeouts**: Ensure that your firewall settings allow traffic on the required ports.
- **Pod CrashLoopBackOff**: Check your application logs for errors and verify that all configurations are correct.
